        <h1>Haos</h1>
        <p>Haos is born from Vestroia’s radiant realm of blinding light and celestial energy. Haos Bakugan glow with an ethereal aura, often resembling angelic or star-like beings. They are strategic and resourceful, using light to outsmart opponents rather than overpower them.</p>
        <p>In the anime, Runo Misaki’s Tigrerra showcases Haos’ sense of justice, often winning through clever tricks rather than raw power to avenge her friends and rebuke enemies. Haos Bakugan can manipulate light to blind foes, create illusions, or boost weaker allies. Their abilities often allow lower-powered Bakugan to triumph through tactical brilliance.</p>
        <h2>Notable Bakugan</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tigrerra (Runo’s partner in season 1)</li>
            <li>Nemus (Baron's partner in season 2)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Battle Style</h2>
        <p>Strategic and deceptive, using light-based tricks to turn the tide of battle in their favor.</p>
        <h2>Correlation</h2>
        <p>The strongest opposing force of Haos is Ventus.</p>
